# Codebase-Insights-Spring22-Independent-Study
Spring 2022 Independent Study project I completed for Professor Gregory Rawlins with six other students during my final semester of graduate school. We independently designed and developed a full-stack codebase analysis tool deployed as a webservice on AWS with a vscode extension frontend.
